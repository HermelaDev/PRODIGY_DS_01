# Kenya Population Distribution Analysis (2019 Census)

This project visualizes the gender-wise population distribution across Kenyan counties based on the 2019 Census data. The analysis uses R and the ggplot2 package to generate insightful visualizations for understanding demographic patterns.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the population distribution by gender (Male, Female, Intersex) for each county in Kenya.
- Visualize the data using grouped and stacked bar charts.
- Identify the top 5 most populous counties and explore their gender distribution.

## Features
- **Grouped Bar Chart**: Displays the population distribution (Male, Female, Intersex) for all counties in Kenya.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Focuses on the top 5 most populous counties to give a clear overview of gender distribution.

## Tools Used
**R**:
  - **ggplot2**: Visualization of the gender-wise distribution.
